==recordkeeping for dupermarket transactions==

Essentially, a double-entry bookkeeping database, implemented with Ruby on Rails.
Special attention is given to ease of data entry of dupermarket receipts.

TODO:

* Make one-to-many form for transaction with associated entries on same form

* Change /accounts view to display nice traditional two column chart of accounts

* Make items/new view redirect back to itself for easier bulk data entry sessions

* Follow steps in http://stackoverflow.com/a/23406453/948073 to change name of Transaction model, as we seem to have fallen into the trap described at http://stackoverflow.com/q/28698986/948073
