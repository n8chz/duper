TODO:

* Change /accounts view to display nice traditional two column chart of accounts

* Set default value of expense account on debit side of transaktions/new if generic description is already associated with exactly one expense account

* Make account fields required in transaktions/new

* Make a "clear form" button for transaktions/new
